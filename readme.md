+ Polygon Builder

This is a utility for building polygons visually based on an image layered underneath a transparent canvas.

Click the image to create polygons. To avoid minor gaps or overlaps between polygons, click points snap to existing points.

I built this for my own convenience, not really intending to be distributed widely. However feel free to use it for your own purposes.
